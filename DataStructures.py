##Heap Sort
Approach:
#  Heap sort happens in two phases. In the first phase, the array
#  is transformed into a heap. A heap is a binary tree where
#  1) each node is greater than each of its children
#  2) the tree is perfectly balanced
#  3) all leaves are in the leftmost position available.
#  In phase two the heap is continuously reduced to a sorted array:
#  1) while the heap is not empty
#  - remove the top of the head into an array
#  - fix the heap.
#  Heap sort was invented by John Williams not by B. R. Heap.
#
#  MoveDown:
#  The movedown method checks and verifies that the structure is a heap.
#
#  Technical Details:
#  A heap is based on an array just as a hashmap is based on an
#  array. For a heap, the children of an element n are at index
#  2n+1 for the left child and 2n+2 for the right child.
#
#  The movedown function checks that an element is greater than its
#  children. If not the values of element and child are swapped. The
#  function continues to check and swap until the element is at a
#  position where it is greater than its children.

  for i in range ( leastParent, -1, -1 ):
    moveDown( aList, i, length )
 
  # flatten heap into sorted array
  for i in range ( length, 0, -1 ):
    if aList[0] > aList[i]:
      swap( aList, 0, i )
      moveDown( aList, 0, i - 1 )

  largest = 2 * first + 1
  while largest <= last:
    # right child exists and is larger than left child
    if ( largest < last ) and ( aList[largest] < aList[largest + 1] ):
      largest += 1
 
    # right child is larger than parent
    if aList[largest] > aList[first]:
      swap( aList, largest, first )
      # move down to largest child
      first = largest;
      largest = 2 * first + 1
